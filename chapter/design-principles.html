    <h1>Design Principles</h1>

    <div>
        The challenge is to develop an application that tries to increase the user’s participation
        in team sports
        through
        online communities. Several factors play into the success of this concept. It is not possible to achieve this
        goal
        if the application is not properly designed. To achieve this, design principles of several disciplines are
        applied
        to achieve a user-centric solution.
    </div>
    <h2>User Experience Design</h2>
    <main>The term "user experience" was first coined by Don Norman in the early 1990s when he was working at Apple
        <cite>(NORMAN,
            2013, P. XIII F.).</cite> User experience comprises all aspects of a user’s interaction with a company, its
        services,
        and
        its products. The focus and most important goal of good user experience is to meet the user’s needs in every
        aspects. Close cooperation is required between different disciplines, such as engineering, marketing, graphic
        design, industrial design, and interface design <cite>(NORMAN & NIELSEN, N.D.)</cite>.
    </main>
    
        <blockquote style="color:rgb(196, 166, 0);"> »Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part
            because
            good
            designs fit our needs so well that the design is invisible, serving us without drawing attention to itself.
            Bad
            design, on the other hand, screams out its inadequacies, making itself very noticeable.«

    <section>User Experience Design requires a solid understanding of the psychology and behavior of the user.
        Understanding
        how
        users perceive a product allows user experience designers to iterate their concepts and better achieve the
        user’s
        goals. According to Marc Hassenzahl and Sarah Diefenbach’s paper <i>Well-being</i>, <i>Need Fulfillment</i>, and
        <i>Experience
            Design</i>, any positive experience is based on meeting psychological needs. The fulfillment of
        psychological
        needs,
        such as competence, relatedness, popularity, stimulation and security, contributes to the well-being of the user
        and
        leads to a pleasant user experience. In experience design, these needs are taken as guidelines and inspiration
        in
        the design process <cite>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1).</cite>
    </section>
    <aside> Some of these needs have already been discussed in Chapter 2.1, but in the following, they are considered
        from
        the
        perspective of emotion, while additional needs are addressed.</aside>

    <dl>
        <dt>Competence</dt>
        <dd>Competence is the feeling that one’s actions are perceived as capable and effective instead of thinking that
            one is incapable and incompetent <cite>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1).</cite></dd>

        <dt>Relatedness</dt>
        <dd>Relatedness is the feeling of having intimate and personal relationships with the people in the
            environment, rather than feeling lonely or unnoticed <cite>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1).</cite>
        </dd>

        <dt>Popularity</dt>
        <dd>Popularity is the feeling of being respected and influencing others, rather than feeling like a person
            whose advice and opinion are ignored <cite>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</cite>.</dd>

        <dt>Stimulation</dt>
        <dd> Stimulation is the feeling of experiencing much of joy and pleasure instead of feeling bored and
            understimulated <cite>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1).</cite></dd>

        <dt>Security</dt>
        <dd> Security is the feeling of having stability and control over one’s own life, rather than feeling uncertain
            and threatened by circumstances one cannot control <cite>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</cite>.</dd>
    </dl>
    <section>As discussed in Chapter 2.1, the social aspect is an important factor in motivating people to participate
        in
        various activities. Thus, it is also an important factor for participation in sports. Since this thesis
        addresses the question of how online sports community apps should be designed to increase the user’s
        participation in team sports, the focus during the design phase is laid especially on relatedness.</section>
       
    <section>In the context of user experience design, needs are also called “user needs”. In addition to the approach
        of
        Hassenzahl and Diefenbach, other approaches define user needs for good user experience. Design leader
        Stephen P. Anderson, for example, developed the “User Experience Hierarchy of Needs” model <cite>(→ FIG.
            05).</cite>
        Rather than focusing on the psychological side of the user needs, this model is based on a product’s
        maturity process. Anderson proposes that products proceed through six stages of maturity, during which they
        can grow from a purely functional product, to a product that is meaningful to the user <cite>(ANDERSON, 2011, P.
            10F.).</cite>
